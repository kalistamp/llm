# Introduction to Generative AI and Large Language Models

```How do large language models work?```

In the next chapter we are going to explore different types of Generative AI models, but for now let’s have a look at how large language models work, with a focus on OpenAI GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models.

Tokenizer, text to numbers: Large Language Models receive a text as input and generate a text as output. However, being statistical models, they work much better with numbers than text sequences. That’s why every input to the model is processed by a tokenizer, before being used by the core model. A token is a chunk of text – consisting of a variable number of characters, so the tokenizer's main task is splitting the input into an array of tokens. Then, each token is mapped with a token index, which is the integer encoding of the original text chunk.
